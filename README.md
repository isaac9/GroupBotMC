# GroupBotMC
The plugin that sets up your server or plugin* faster and easier
At GroupBot we create Server-help plugins and pages
This makes doing hard boring setup or coding easier for you, the player.
So far we have started our Website and have released GroupBot 1.0 Beta, 
currently we are also creating a Spigot and Bukkit page as well.
We hope GroupBot satisfies you and runs perfectly without any issues

------------------------- Plugin Setup -----------------------

1. Download the Newest GroupBot.jar from here

2. Move it to your plugins folder (You need Bukkit to run plugins

3. Run your server

4. If GroupBot is enabled then you have succesfully installed GroupBot

5. If you do not have a server then Bukkit server setup is below :)

------------------------- Server Setup -----------------------

Welcome to the Officail GroupBot Server installer!
If you'd rather have a video on how to install go to
https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools/

------------------------- Requirements -----------------------

1. Java 64 bit (If you don't have this double click this link
http://www.java64.net/download/jre-8-windows-x64.exe)

2. Windows Operating System, (recommended) (will work with Apple or Linux)
(GroupBot doesn't suppy an Apple or Linux version but we do have a tutorial)


------------------------- To Install -------------------------

1. Extract all files into a desktop folder

2. Move folder named "minecraft server" into your desktop as a standalone folder

3. Keep the BuildTools.exe and BukkitGUI.exe in the minecraft server folder

4. Double click the Buildtools.exe and hit "Update BuildTools"

5. Download if not up to date, move on if it is already up to date

6. Click "Run BuildTools"

7. This should take up to 15 mins

8. If succesfully installed there should be 6 files in your BuildTools folder
    (If not then go back to step 6 and retry)
	(If fails again then restart your computer, uninstall mysgit, and go back to step 4 and retry)

9. Now that you have BuildTools you can choose between a Spigot server and a Bukkit server (See below for Pro/Cons)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Spigot:
	 Pro: User friendly server good for beginners, newbies, or small servers
	 Pro: Works well with spigot essentials (The main plugin w/ tons of commands)
	 Con: Bukkit was the first to do this but Spigot is more Optimized
	
	Bukkit
	 Pro: works flawlessly with other essentials  
	 Con: better for expirenced people (not user friendly)	 
	 Con: Hard to find a download for it (GroupBot fixed that)(Also BuildTools has it now)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	

10. Once you have chosen your server type then go into the folder with the name of of server on it,
    copy it and paste it into the mincraft server desktop folder
    (The one that has the BuildTools folder in it)

11. Double Click the .jar file and it should generate some files

12. Once it is done, double click "EULA" and change the text that says "false" to "true"

13. Repeat step 13 and it should generate more files (if not go back to step 14)
	
14. Run BukkitGUI and go to SuperStart, then go to "Java version" and select Jre8x64

15. Then go to "JAR file" and select "minecraft server" then select the the server type (Bukkit/Spigot.jar)
    double click and it should go back. IT SHOULD LOOK LIKE THIS:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

JAR file: C:\Users\{Your Username}\Desktop\minecraft server\{Server Type}.jar	

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

16. Go to "Max RAM" and bring the notch halfway

17. Finally go to "Start Server" and Double Click it

18. If your server doesn't work, try disabling your firewall, Reinstalling Java or getting a 32bit version, delete all files (except BuildTools), and repeat from step 6
    If all else fails delete the minecraft server folder and re-download from GroupBot at http://groupbotmc.com/

19. Good job you have succesfully dowloaded and installed a server!
